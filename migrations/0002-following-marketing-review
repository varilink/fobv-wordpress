<p class="pb-3">Bennerley Viaduct is a grade 2* listed  railway viaduct built in 1877 by the Great Northern Railway Company. At over quarter of a mile long, it is the longest wrought iron viaduct in the country.  It straddles the River Erewash connecting Ilkeston in Derbyshire with Awsworth in Nottinghamshire.</p>

<p class="pb-3">The "Iron Giant" has been described by the World Monuments Fund as being an "extraordinary monument"  meriting inclusion  in the <a href="https://www.wmf.org/2020Watch">2020 World Monuments Watch</a>, one of only 25 sites chosen globally.  Historic England consider the viaduct is a “stunning example of the genius of British Engineering”</p>

<p class="mt-2">The Friends of Bennerley Viaduct are dedicated to give our "Iron Giant" a new lease of life.  Working in partnership with the owners, Railway Paths Limited, an inspiring community driven project is bringing the iconic structure  back to life.  In 2021, Bennerley Viaduct should be re-opened to the public following fifty years of closure following a £1.4 million investment.</p>
